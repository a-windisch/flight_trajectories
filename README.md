### 0 Synopsis   
In this repository, I collect and analyze some of the data that I recorded from the sensors of my cell phone when plioting general aviation aircraft. Apart from position (WGS84), I also recorded altitude, magnetic heading, ground speed, and data from the accelerometers.
Feel free to use the data as you please. You can contact me using andreas.windisch@yahoo.com. You can also find and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-windisch-physics/).

#### C152_N53398_KCPS_to_KSLO_2017-10-29.csv     
This file contains data recorded on October 29 2017 when flying a Cessna 152 (N53398) from St. Louis Downtown Airport (KCPS) to Salem Leckrone airport (KSLO). The data covers only the trip to KSLO, as well as a touch-and-go maneuver executed at KSLO. The recording ends shortly after the climb-out after the touch-and-go. I started the trip with full tanks and had no passenger on this flight. The flight was uneventful. The sample rate of the recording is 1 Hz. Here is an open streetmap image of the flight, produced by the R-script I provide in this repository. The plot has been created with the R-package leaflet.

#### DA20-C1_N107TX_KSUS_to_1H3_2018-07-17.csv   
This file contains data recorded on July 17 2018 when flying a Diamond Aircraft DA-20 C1 Eclipse (N107TX) from Spirit of St. Louis Airport (KSUS) to State Technical College of Missouri Airport (1H3). The data covers both, the trip to 1H3 and back to KSUS. I started out with full tanks, and I was the only occupant of the plane. When closing in on 1H3 I had to choose a lower altitude because of the ceilings becoming lower to the west. At 1H3, I executed 2 go-around maneuvers and one touch-and-go. After that, I flew straight back to KSUS. Here is the map of the recorded flight.

#### DA20-C1_N107TX_KSUS_to_KMYJ_2018-09-15.csv 
This file contains data recorded on September 15 2018 when flying a Diamond Aircraft DA-20 C1 Eclipse (N107TX) from Spirit of St. Louis Airport (KSUS) to Mexico Memorial Airport (KMYJ). I started out at KSUS with full tanks and I was the sole occupant of the aircraft. The flight was uneventful. I executed a touch-and-go maneuver at KMYJ and flew straight back to KSUS. Here is the map of the full recording.
