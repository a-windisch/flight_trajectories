### 0 Synopsis   
In this repository, I collect and analyze some of the data that I recorded from the sensors of my cell phone when plioting general aviation aircraft. Apart from position (WGS84), I also recorded altitude, magnetic heading, ground speed, and data from the accelerometers.
Feel free to use the data as you please. You can also find and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-windisch-physics/)).
