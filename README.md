### 0 Synopsis   
In this repository, I collect and analyze some of the data that I recorded from the sensors of my cell phone when plioting general aviation aircraft. Apart from position (WGS84), I also recorded altitude, magnetic heading, ground speed, and data from the accelerometers.
Feel free to use the data as you please. You can also find and connect with me on LinkedIn.
